# ICE CREAM TRUCK  - ROBOT CAR



## Project Idea:

  With parts from our 4180 robot kit kit we decided incorporate everything we learned of embedded devices  into a small  battery-powered robot that can be remotely controlled via bluetooth with fully motor support and  turning capabilities. It also possesses an LCD screen that displays the status of the robot, speakers that play a tune as the robot moves, and SONAR sensor that relay distance information and stops the robot if anything is detected with within a certain distance in front of behind it. It makes for our very own  mininature ice cram truck.
